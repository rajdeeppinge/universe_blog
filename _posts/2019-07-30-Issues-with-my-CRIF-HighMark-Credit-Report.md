title: "Issues with my CRIF HighMark Credit Report"

CRIF HighMark provides us with one free credit report every calendar year as per the RBI directive of 2017. The process has been documented [here](https://shodhfortruth.blogspot.com/2019/07/crif-highmark-credit-report-application.html). Using this process, I applied for my credit report on 13th July, 2019. I received a verification email on 14th July and finally received the report on 16th July. It took almost 3 days to receive my credit report.  
  
I opened the report and to my dismay, the information was not accurate. They had mixed my report with my father's report. Even the mix-up was not correct. Only a partial credit history of my father was present in the report. Although my full credit history was present, the credit score could not be a reliable indicator because of the mistakes.  
  
I raised a dispute on 20th July, 2019. I highlighted around 15-20 errors and got an acknowledgement email with reference number. I received a reply on 23rd stating that "they cannot make changes to the report as the data is provided by banks and financial institutions." I replied on 24th and clarified that there is no issue with data but unrelated data has been put into my report. I haven't received any response since. I will update this post when I get a response.  
  
**Update 30th August, 2019:**  
I raised another dispute on 25th August, 2019 but haven't got any reply.
