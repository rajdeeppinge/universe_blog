I was in 8th standard, just coming to terms with the thought of completing 7 long years of formal education. Even today, I still can't think how I have managed to complete 16 years of formal education because I am a person who easily gets bored of common things and especially studying. So, coming to the halfway point in my formal education, there was going to be a slight change in my subjects because I had decided to take full Sanskrit as my 2nd language instead of Hindi. And there started a memorable journey which I am sure will go on till the end (Note: 'end' means end of my life which will not come very soon because I intend to live for at least a 100 years, maybe more based on how much scientific progress is done till that time :p)

  
So. It all started with the following _shlok_.

  
  


**सरस्वतीयं विद्यानां देवता ज्ञानदायिनी |**

**अस्या वरदहस्तेन ज्ञानवान खलु मानवः ||**

  


Seems very complex, isn't it? According to Hindu rituals, we start any new journey by taking the name of God and what better way to start learning Sanskrit than by taking the name of _Saraswati_ \- The Goddess of Knowledge?

The meaning of the _shlok_ is very simple. It states that _Saraswati_ is the goddess of knowledge. She is the source of knowledge and her blessings make the humans (more) knowledgeable.

  
Somehow, I still remember it with its complete meaning. The principle is very important here. When will we get the blessings of the goddess? When we ourselves put in effort to obtain the knowledge. So, actually, we ourselves are responsible for the knowledge we acquire.

  
  
  
There are many such small teachings and derived meanings which quickly made sanskrit one of my favourite subjects and gave me some of my best school days during those 3 years from 8th standard to 10th standard. Even after 6 years have passed by, I still remember the simple stories and _shlokas_ which always teach us something through common but beautiful examples in life.

  
This blog is an attempt to remember and reflect on such stories and teachings in a fun way and find their relevance in today's world. Wait for more... Patience is key ;).
