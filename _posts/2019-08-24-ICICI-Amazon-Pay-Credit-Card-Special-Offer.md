This week, while going through Credit Card statement for Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card, I came across the following dining offer.

It is a pretty decent offer with no restrictions on the restaurants where the offer can be availed. So if you are one lucky person who has got the Amazon Pay ICICI Card, use it once per month in August and September, 2019 to get your 20% cashback. Remember to use the card wisely to optimize your returns as the offer is only valid on the first transaction of the month.  
  


####  Update: 4th September, 2019

While the offer came too late for me to get cashback for August, I did make my first dining transaction of September on the very 1st day. Today, I received a message today stating that the cashback will be credited by 15th of next month.  
  


####  Update: 20th October, 2019

I recently received my credit card statement and the cashback for the above offer has been credited as statement credit on 14th October, 2019. I'm glad to see that the offer has been fulfilled automatically in the stipulated time and I did not have to run behind customer care executives.
