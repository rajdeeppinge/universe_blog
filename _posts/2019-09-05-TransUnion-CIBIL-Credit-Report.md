In today's world, having a good credit score has become very important to get approval for loans and credit cards. In order to allow everyone to keep track of their credit history, RBI, through its circular in 2017, made it compulsory for each of the credit bureaus of India to provide one free credit report to every customer per calendar year. This post focuses on the process to see your credit report provided by TransUnion CIBIL, the oldest and most famous credit bureau of India.

In case you already have an account, click on "**Member Login** " in the top right corner. Otherwise, register by filling up your personal details.
  3. After completing the registration process, you will receive an OTP to access your credit score and report. Enter the OTP and you will immediately see your credit score and report.

CIBIL has provided a very quick and convenient process to see your credit report unlike CRIF HighMark which has a lengthy process spanning multiple days. You can read more about CRIF HighMark credit report application process [here](https://shodhfortruth.blogspot.com/2019/07/crif-highmark-credit-report-application.html).  
  
Also, my cibil credit report was accurate. I did not find any discrepancies. In CRIF HighMark report I had faced an issue where some of my father's credit history was clubbed with my credit history.  
  
I had read somewhere that cibil report and dispute mechanism is not so good. I don't know about disputes but the report generation process is pretty smooth and fast.
