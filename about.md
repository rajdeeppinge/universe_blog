There is so much knowledge around us and it is growing at such a rapid pace that human beings are not capable of keeping everything in their brain let alone remember the important things when required. My interests in a variety of fields ranging from technology, finance, law, world affairs to my childhood interest in Sanskrit language and my hobbies has always stimulated my desire to study and get to know about various topics related to these fields. I strive to understand diverse aspects and different viewpoints and also try to develop my opinion based on the knowledge that I have gained and from experiences of people around me. Generally, my understanding of the topic improves by writing about and trying to explain it to a layperson in the simplest of words. I would be working to improve my knowledge of various topics and hope to document my journey in the world for a few decades as a guest in this universe.
